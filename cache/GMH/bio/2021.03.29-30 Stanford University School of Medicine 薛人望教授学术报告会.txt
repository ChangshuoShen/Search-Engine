个人简介：
       
Aaron Hsueh (Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford University School of Medicine) is an ovarian physiologist and has published in the field for decades with >390 refereed papers.  His lab has investigated the hormonal regulation of 
granulosa
 cell functions, leading to the establishment of a sensitive in vitro FSH bioassay and the application of a long-acting FSH analog (ELONVA) now in clinical use. His lab also contributed to the understanding of ovarian follicle growth and atresia, 
intraovarian
 mechanisms of oocyte maturation, and 
autocrine
/paracrine regulation of early embryonic development.  His lab cloned human FSH and LH receptors together with five related receptors (named them as LGR4-8) before identifying LGR7 as the 
relaxin
 receptor.
  
The Hsueh lab established and maintained the Ovarian Kaleidoscope Database (
OKdb
, 
http://okdb.appliedbioinfo.net/4_search.html
) over 20 years as an online resource for ovarian researchers to search for ovarian literature and DNA microarray data, together with Human Plasma Membrane 
Receptome
 (HPMR: 
http://www.receptome.org/
), listing all human plasma membrane receptors linked to their cognate ligands.
  
In 2013, his lab established an in vitro activation (IVA) method to activate ovarian 
preantral
 follicles for the derivation of mature oocytes in patients with primary ovarian insufficiency and low ovarian reserve.
