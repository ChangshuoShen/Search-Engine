报告摘要：
Neurons in the brain communicate with each other at synapses. A typical pyramidal neuron in the brain receives inputs from >10,000 synapses. Many of the excitatory synapses are formed at a small protrusion of dendrites, known as dendritic spines. However, their distribution on a whole-neuron scale has not been fully established due to technical limitations. We previously developed a tissue clearing agent, SeeDB2, which is optimized for high-resolution fluorescence imaging. The refractive index of SeeDB2 is matched to that of immersion oil (1.518), allowing for volume imaging with high-NA oil-immersion objective lenses with minimal spherical aberrations. Combined with Airyscan microscopy, our strategy allows for large-scale analyses with a constant spatial resolution of ~150 nm in 
x-y
 and ~300 nm in 
z
, which is sufficient to quantify the number and size of dendritic spines unambiguously. Here we performed comprehensive high-resolution mapping of dendritic spines in layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons in mice, and found that the spine density is highly biased along apical dendrites, forming a spine density “hotspot”. The spine density at the hotspot increased during adolescence, when other parts of the dendrites underwent a moderate reduction. Thus, the spine density is dynamically controlled during adolescence to form mature cortical circuits.
