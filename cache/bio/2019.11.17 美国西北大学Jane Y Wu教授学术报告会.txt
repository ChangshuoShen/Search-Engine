报告人简介：
Prof. Wu obtained her MD from Shanghai Second Medical University in 1986 and Ph.D from Stanford University in 1991. She was elected as the fellow of of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 2012. The primary research interests of Prof. Wu’s lab are in molecular mechanisms of gene regulation, particularly those involved in neural development and neural degeneration. Her lab is focusing on two areas, RNA regulation and mechanisms underlying cell migration with particular interest in molecular/cellular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders, cancer invasion/metastasis and neurodegenerative diseases.
