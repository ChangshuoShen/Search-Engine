Abstract:Kinetochores are large protein complexes that attach chromosomes, through their centromeres, to the mitotic spindle. By assembling onto the specialized centromeric Cenp-A nucleosome, kinetochores provide load-bearing structures for microtubule-mediated chromosome segregation in mitosis. The inner and outer kinetochores are responsible for interacting with centromeric chromatin and microtubules, respectively. We have reconstituted the inner kinetochore onto a specialised Cenp-A nucleosome. I will describe the cryo-EM structure of the S. cerevisiae inner kinetochore 14-subunit CCAN complex assembled onto a Cenp-A nucleosome. The structure explains the inter-dependency of CCAN constituent sub-complexes and how the inner kinetochore interacts with the octameric Cenp-A nucleosome. The CCAN

Cenp-A structure provides a framework for understanding how kinetochores link centromeres to microtubules for chromosome segregation.
